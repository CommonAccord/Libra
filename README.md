# Libra
Some documents from the Libra.Org initiative.

Libra.Org is a new initiative to create a global system of payments. It will have rules and governing documents.   It may have an impact on the social contract.  This is intended to put a few documents into Prose Object format.

The repo is at github.com/CommonAccord/Libra.

It can be seen at http://www.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=G/Libra/

This repo is intended to be mounted as /G/Libra  - it depends on /Z/
